## How to run
Run the App.Java file with whatever program you usually use to open Java files. For example, I use Eclipse. Then navigate to localhost:4567 and follow the instructions on the page.

## Inspiration
Whenever I am doing my Spanish readings, I often find myself getting lost. I probably understand around 19 words out of every 20, but, for me, it is important that I understand all 20. That's how I will truly understand the text. Furthermore, it was always really annoying to have to look up each individual word, and, oftentimes, I would just not look them up because I was too lazy. To combat this problem, I built this webapp to be able to better understand my Spanish homework and to allow other to understand theirs. 

## What it does
Any user of 'Help me read Spanish' simply needs to paste in a text in English or Spanish and click a submit button. That button will redirect them to a page where every word is a hyperlink, a live translator will provide output for a selected word, and the user can save words that they want to learn.

## How I built it
I decided to use a webapp framework that I used in my Software Engineering class at Brown in tandem with some html and javascript. Additionally, I decided to use SpanishDict as my translating software, although I did have to build a pseudo-'API' to get it to work.

## Challenges I ran into
I had a lot of trouble developing my aforementioned psuedo-'API' to get the translations for Spanish and English words. Additionally, I really wanted to be able to translate phrases, since so much of language is idiomatic. I was able to address both of these challenges by understanding the source material for my translations better and developing a backend-frontend collaboration to translate some, but not all, phrases.

## Accomplishments that I'm proud of
I think that this is something that I can actually see myself using when I am doing homework. I feel like other students of Spanish or English can actually take advantage of this almost fully-fledged webapp to understand more of the language that they want to learn.

## What I learned
I feel like I learned quite a bit about the methods of translation and developing webapps. I was also able to augment my frontend skills, since some of the actions that I wanted to perform necessitated being able to extract data using only html or javascript.

## What's next for Help me read Spanish
I still feel like translation for phrases can be better and that some of my translation calls are suboptimal. I think that I could look more toward making the app more efficient and more encompassing in its translations so that it would be much easier for users to take advantage of.
